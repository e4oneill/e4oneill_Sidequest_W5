## Description

This game is a simple vertical platformer which is meant to evoke the emaotion of serenity. I didnt want the game to be too complex just calming and fun, inspired by Mario 64 the game we played in class. Similar to this game I included beautiful and vibrant visuals, as the character jumps their way up the map the sky changes behind them from day time, to sunset to a beautiful starry night sky. The camera follows them up the map as they play however as the player gets higher and higher the camera and blob movements get slower and slower forcing the player to take in the scenery and enjoy the moment. Compared to the beginning of the game when the camera movements are quite fast. At the top of the map there is a yellow "door" which when the blob hits the game restarts so the players can go on for infinity taking in the beautiful and calming atmosphere.
